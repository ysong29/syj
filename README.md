# THIS IS MY AWESOME PROJECT
Introduction:
My project aim to predict the 18-19 regular season MVP(most valuable player) of NBA (hopefully I can get it done)
Author: Yingjian Song
Proposal:
This project basically consists of 5 steps:
1. Collecting data from Basketball Reference website and choose data which matters mvp evaluation of some competitive candidate of mvp in past ten years.
2. I'm planning to use Neural Networks to be prediction model.
3. After knowing the connection between data of players and mvp, we can train data from 08 to 16 and do some adjustments in the meanwhile to get a better fit model.
4. We use data from 16 to 18 to test our model and see if it fits the results of those 2 years.
5. Last step is going to predict the mvp of 18-19 regular season mvp of NBA.
